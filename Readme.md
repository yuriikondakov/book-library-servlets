#### Library System
Create a catalog where you can search by:
* To the author (one of the group).
* The name of the book or its fragment.
* One of the bookâ€™s keywords (book attribute).

The catalog of books is filled by the Administrator, adding and modifying / deleting them.

Each book should have: an address (shelf space) or a reader.

The reader to take the book is registered, leaving an e-mail and a phone number.

The book can be taken from the Administrator in the library for a period of not more than a month, only if
if the book is available in the library.
 
The administrator must have a page where the books taken and the readers who use the book are displayed.
